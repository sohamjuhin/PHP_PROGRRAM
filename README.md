Algorithm-ã€‹Hash
--------------------
A cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of an arbitrary size (often called the "message") to a bit array of a fixed size (the "hash value", "hash", or "message digest"). It is a one-way function, that is, a function for which it is practically infeasible to invert or reverse the computation.[1] Ideally, the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match, or use a rainbow table of matched hashes. Cryptographic hash functions are a basic tool of modern cryptography.
A cryptographic hash function must be deterministic, meaning that the same message always results in the same hash. Ideally it should also have the following properties:

it is quick to compute the hash value for any given messageit is infeasible to generate a message that yields a given hash value (i.e. to reverse the process that generated the given hash value)it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value etc.
